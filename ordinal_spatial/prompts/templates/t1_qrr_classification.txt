You are evaluating spatial relationships in a 3D scene.

TASK: Compare the 3D distances between two object pairs.

=== SCENE OBJECTS ===
{object_descriptions}

=== QUERY ===
Compare: dist(A,B) vs dist(C,D)

Objects:
- A = {obj_A} ({obj_A_desc})
- B = {obj_B} ({obj_B_desc})
- C = {obj_C} ({obj_C_desc})
- D = {obj_D} ({obj_D_desc})

Question: Is the 3D distance between A-B less than, approximately equal to,
or greater than the 3D distance between C-D?

=== TOLERANCE ===
τ = {tau} ({tau_percent}%)

Two distances d1 and d2 are "approximately equal" if:
|d1 - d2| ≤ {tau} × max(d1, d2)

=== DEPTH CUE REMINDERS ===
- Objects lower in image are typically closer (on ground plane)
- Larger apparent size indicates closer distance
- Occluding objects are in front of occluded objects
- Consider the FULL 3D distance, not just horizontal spread

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Respond with ONLY a JSON object (no other text):
{{
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your spatial analysis",
  "comparator": "<" | "~=" | ">",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}}

Where:
- "<" means dist(A,B) is clearly smaller than dist(C,D)
- "~=" means the distances are approximately equal (within tolerance)
- ">" means dist(A,B) is clearly larger than dist(C,D)
