You are evaluating directional relationships in a 3D scene.

TASK: Determine the clock-face position of a target object relative to
a reference axis defined by two other objects.

=== SCENE OBJECTS ===
{object_descriptions}

=== QUERY ===
Determine: CLOCK(A | B → C)

Objects:
- A (target) = {obj_A} ({obj_A_desc})
- B (origin) = {obj_B} ({obj_B_desc})
- C (direction reference) = {obj_C} ({obj_C_desc})

Question: Standing at B and looking toward C, at what clock position is A?

=== CLOCK MODEL ===
Imagine you are standing at object B, looking toward object C:

         11  12  1
       10    ↑     2
      9  ← B → C   3
       8    ↓     4
         7   6   5

- Hour 12: Directly toward C (forward)
- Hour 3: 90° to the right of C
- Hour 6: Directly away from C (behind)
- Hour 9: 90° to the left of C

Each hour spans 30°. Hours increase clockwise.

=== QUADRANT REFERENCE ===
- Quadrant 1: Hours 11, 12, 1, 2 (forward-right toward C)
- Quadrant 2: Hours 3, 4, 5 (right-back)
- Quadrant 3: Hours 6, 7, 8 (back-left)
- Quadrant 4: Hours 9, 10 (left-forward)

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Respond with ONLY a JSON object (no other text):
{{
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the directional relationship",
  "hour": 1-12,
  "quadrant": 1-4,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}}
